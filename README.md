**Calculator README**

This is a basic calculator web application built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It provides simple arithmetic operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as the ability to clear the input, delete the last character, calculate percentages, and obtain the result of an expression.

**Usage:**
1. **AC (All Clear):** Click the "AC" button to clear the display.
2. **DEL (Delete):** Click the "DEL" button to remove the last character from the display.
3. **Percentage (%):** Click the "%" button to calculate percentages.
4. **Basic Arithmetic:** Use the numeric buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
5. **Operators (+, -, *, /):** Use the operator buttons to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
6. **Equals (=):** Click the "=" button to evaluate the expression and display the result.

**How It Works:**
- The application uses HTML to structure the calculator, JavaScript for its functionality, and CSS for styling.
- When a button is clicked, the JavaScript code processes the input, handles arithmetic operations, and updates the display accordingly.
- The result is displayed in real-time in the text input field.

**Installation:**
